# Pacmann SQL Project: Secondhand Car Marketplace

This project is a simulation of a secondhand car marketplace where users can buy and sell used cars. The project uses PostgreSQL as the database management system and Python as the scripting language. The project consists of the following components:

- Data: A folder that contains the original dataset of used cars obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/used-cars-dataets) and a Python script that generates synthetic data for the users, advertisements, bids and cities tables.
- Output: A folder that contains the CSV files of the synthetic data generated by the Python script.
- Py scripts: A folder that contains the Python scripts that generate the synthetic data for each table using the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library.
- 01-create-tables.sql: A SQL script that creates the tables and constraints for the database schema.
- 02-transactional-queries.sql: A SQL script that performs some transactional queries on the database, such as inserting, updating and deleting records.
- 03-analytical-queries.sql: A SQL script that performs some analytical queries on the database, such as aggregating, joining and filtering data.
- data_generator.py: A Python script that runs all the py scripts in the Py scripts folder and generates the CSV files in the Output folder.
- ERD.png: An image file that shows the entity-relationship diagram of the database schema.
- import_csv.py: A Python script that imports the CSV files in the Output folder into the PostgreSQL database.

## Project overview

The project simulates a secondhand car marketplace where users can buy and sell used cars. The database schema consists of six tables:

- Users: This table stores information about the users of the marketplace, such as their name, contact, address and city id.
- Products: This table stores information about the used cars that are available for sale, such as their brand, model, year, price, body type and transmission type.
- Advertisements: This table stores information about the advertisements posted by the sellers, such as their title, details, product id, mileage, color, transmission, negotiable status and post date.
- Bids: This table stores information about the bids made by the buyers on the advertisements, such as their amount, time, user id and advertisement id.
- Cities: This table stores information about the cities where the users and products are located, such as their name, latitude and longitude.
- Vehicles: This table stores information about all kinds of vehicles obtained from Kaggle, such as their make, model, year, body style and engine.

## Database Schema

This part of the project describes the database schema that models the secondhand car marketplace. The schema consists of six tables: city, user_data, product, advertisement, bid and vehicle. The tables are created using SQL and have primary keys, foreign keys and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### City table

This table stores information about the cities where the users and products are located, such as their name, latitude and longitude. The table has a serial primary key called city_id and a unique constraint on the combination of latitude and longitude.

```sql
-- Create city table
CREATE TABLE city (
  city_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  city_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  latitude NUMERIC(8, 6) NOT NULL,
  longitude NUMERIC(9, 6) NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(latitude, longitude)
);
```

### User_data table

This table stores information about the users of the marketplace, such as their name, contact, address and city id. The table has a serial primary key called user_id and a foreign key called city_id that references the city table on delete cascade. The table also has a unique constraint on the user_contact column.

```sql
-- Create user table
CREATE TABLE user_data (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_contact TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  city_id INT REFERENCES city(city_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_address TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Product table

This table stores information about the used cars that are available for sale, such as their brand, model, year, price, body type, transmission type and description. The table has a serial primary key called product_id and a foreign key called user_id that references the user_data table on delete cascade.

```sql
-- Create product table
CREATE TABLE product (
  product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  product_brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_model TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_body_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_transmission_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_year INT NOT NULL,
  product_description TEXT,
  product_price NUMERIC(16,2) NOT NULL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_data(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Advertisement table

This table stores information about the advertisements posted by the sellers, such as their title, details, product id, mileage, color, transmission, negotiable status and post date. The table has a serial primary key called advertisement_id and a foreign key called product_id that references the product table on delete cascade. The table also has a unique constraint on the product_id column.

```sql
-- Create advertisement table
CREATE TABLE advertisement (
  advertisement_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  advertisement_title TEXT NOT NULL,
  advertisement_details TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL REFERENCES product(product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  mileage_km INTEGER NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  transmission TEXT NOT NULL,
  negotiable BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  post_date DATE NOT NULL
);
```

### Bid table

This table stores information about the bids made by the buyers on the advertisements, such as their amount, time, user id and advertisement id. The table has a serial primary key called bid_id and two foreign keys called user_id and advertisement_id that reference the user_data and advertisement tables on delete cascade.

```sql
-- Create bid table
CREATE TABLE bid (
  bid_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  bid_amount NUMERIC(16,2) NOT NULL,
  bid_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES user_data(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  advertisement_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES advertisement(advertisement_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Python and PostgreSQL.
- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine. This project is OS independent.
- You have read the PostgreSQL documentation related to the project.

## How to run the project

To run the project, you need to have PostgreSQL and Python installed on your machine. You also need to install some Python libraries, such as psycopg2, pandas and Faker. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install psycopg2 pandas Faker
```

You also need to create a PostgreSQL database and a user with sufficient privileges. You can use pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client to do that. You need to modify the import_csv.py file with your database credentials, such as host, port, user, password and database name.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Download the original dataset of used cars from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/used-cars-datasets) and save it as final_cars_datasets.csv in the Data folder.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the data_generator.py script to generate the synthetic data and save them as CSV files in the Output folder:
5. Create tables using the given SQL queries
6. Run import_csv.py to insert generated data into tables

```bash
python data_generator.py
```
5. Run the 01-create-tables.sql script to create the tables and constraints for the database schema. You can use pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client to do that.

6. Run the import_csv.py script to import the CSV files into your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
python import_csv.py
```

7. Run the 02-transactional-queries.sql and 03-analytical-queries.sql scripts to perform some transactional and analytical queries on the database. You can use pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client to do that.


The project uses Python to generate synthetic data for each table using the Faker library. The original dataset of used cars was obtained from Kaggle using pandas library. The project also uses PostgreSQL to perform some transactional and analytical queries on the database.


## Transactional Queries

This section demonstrates some transactional queries that can be performed on the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records. The queries are written in SQL and can be executed using pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client.

### 1. Finding cars made in 2015 and onwards

This query selects the product id, brand, model, year, and price of the cars that were made in 2015 or later. It filters the `product` table by the `product_year` column and returns the result in a tabular format.

```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  product_brand AS merk,
  product_model AS model,
  product_year AS year,
  product_price AS price
FROM
  product
WHERE
  product_year >= 2015;
```
This image shows the result of the query, displaying the cars made in 2015 and onwards, along with their product ID, brand, model, year, and price.

![Finding cars made in 2015 and onwards](images/transactional-query-01.png)



### 2. Adding a new bid to a product

This query inserts a new record into the `bid` table with the bid amount, bid time, user id, and advertisement id. It uses a subquery to find the advertisement id that corresponds to the product id of the car that the user wants to bid on. It assumes that the user id and the product id are already known.

```sql
-- Join the bid table with the advertisement table and the product table, view the table first
SELECT b.bid_id, b.bid_amount, b.bid_time, b.user_id, b.advertisement_id, a.product_id
FROM bid b
JOIN advertisement a ON b.advertisement_id = a.advertisement_id
JOIN product p ON a.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY bid_id ASC;

-- Insert a new bid data with a different bid_id, for example a new bid_id 51
INSERT INTO bid (bid_id, bid_amount, bid_time, user_id, advertisement_id)
VALUES (51, 185500000, '2022-03-04', 7, 3);
```

![Adding a new bid to a product](images/transactional-query-02a.png)

The first image shows the table data before adding the new bid, displaying the bid information such as bid ID, bid amount, bid time, user ID, advertisement ID, and product ID.

![Adding a new bid to a product](images/transactional-query-02b.png)

The second image shows the updated table after inserting a new bid with bid ID 51 and other relevant information.

### 3. Viewing all cars sold by a specific account, ordered by the newest

This query selects the product id, brand, model, year, price, and post date of the cars that were sold by a specific user account. It joins the `product`, `advertisement`, and `user_data` tables by their foreign keys and filters the result by the `user_name` column. It orders the result by the `post_date` column in descending order.

```sql
SELECT
  p.product_id,
  p.product_brand AS merk,
  p.product_model AS model,
  p.product_year AS year,
  p.product_price AS price,
  a.post_date AS date_post
FROM
  product p
JOIN
  advertisement a ON a.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN
  user_data u ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE
  u.user_name = 'Titin Wijaya'
ORDER BY
  a.post_date DESC;
```
This image shows the result of the query, displaying all cars sold by the specific account "Titin Wijaya". The cars are listed with their product ID, brand, model, year, price, and post date, ordered by the newest.

![Viewing all cars sold by a specific account, ordered by the newest](images/transactional-query-03.png)

### 4. Searching for the cheapest used car based on a keyword

This query selects the product id, brand, model, year, and price of the cheapest car that matches a given keyword. It filters the `product` table by the `product_model` column using the `LIKE` operator with a wildcard character. It orders the result by the `product_price` column in ascending order and limits the result to one record.

```sql
SELECT
  product_id,
  product_brand AS merk,
  product_model AS model,
  product_year AS year,
  product_price AS price
FROM
  product
WHERE
  product_model LIKE '%mpv%'
ORDER BY
  product_price ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This image shows the result of the query, displaying the cheapest used car that matches the keyword "mpv". The car is shown with its product ID, brand, model, year, and price.

![Searching for the cheapest used car based on a keyword](images/transactional-query-04.png)

### 5. Finding the nearest used car based on a city id

This query selects the product id, brand, model, year, price, and distance of the nearest cars based on a given city id. It joins the `product`, `user_data`, and `city` tables by their foreign keys and calculates the distance between each car's location and the given city's location using a rough approximation of Euclidean distance (which does not account for the Earth's curvature). It filters out the cars that are located in the same city as the given city and orders the result by distance in ascending order. It limits the result to ten records.

```sql
-- Finding the nearest used car based on a city id. For example, we will look for the nearest car in city_id = 1
SELECT
  product.product_id,
  product.product_brand AS merk,
  product.product_model AS model,
  product.product_year AS year,
  product.product_price AS price,
  SQRT(
    POWER(city.latitude - user_city.latitude, 2) +
    POWER(city.longitude - user_city.longitude, 2)
  ) AS distance
FROM
  product
JOIN
  user_data ON product.user_id = user_data.user_id
JOIN
  city AS user_city ON user_data.city_id = user_city.city_id
CROSS JOIN
  (
    SELECT
      latitude,
      longitude
    FROM
      city
    WHERE
      city_id = 1
  ) AS city
WHERE
  user_city.city_id <> 1
ORDER BY
  distance ASC
LIMIT 10;
```
This image shows the result of the query, displaying the nearest used cars based on the given city ID. The cars are listed with their product ID, brand, model, year, price, and distance from the specified city.

![Finding the nearest used car based on a city id](images/transactional-query-05.png)




## Analytical Queries

This section demonstrates some analytical queries that can be performed on the database, such as aggregating, joining, and filtering data. The queries are written in SQL and can be executed using pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client.

### 1. Rank car models based on the number of bids

This query selects the product model, the count of distinct products, and the count of bids for each product model. It joins the `product` and `bid` tables by their foreign keys and groups the result by the product model column.

```sql
SELECT
  p.product_model AS model,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_id) AS count_product,
  COUNT(b.bid_id) AS count_bid
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN bid b ON p.product_id = b.advertisement_id
GROUP BY p.product_model
ORDER BY count_bid DESC;
```
 It orders the result by the count of bids in descending order.
 
![Rank car models based on the number of bids](images/analytical-query-01.png)

### 2. Compare car prices based on the average price per city

This query selects the city name, the product brand, model, year, price, and the average price of cars per city. It joins the `product`, `user_data`, and `city` tables by their foreign keys and calculates the average price of cars per city using a window function with a partition by clause. 

```sql
SELECT
  c.city_name AS nama_kota,
  p.product_brand AS merk,
  p.product_model AS model,
  p.product_year AS year,
  p.product_price AS price,
  AVG(p.product_price) OVER (PARTITION BY c.city_name) AS avg_car_city
FROM product p
JOIN user_data u ON p.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN city c ON u.city_id = c.city_id;
```

It returns the result in a tabular format below:
![Compare car prices based on the average price per city](images/analytical-query-02.png)


### 3. From the offers of a car model, find the comparison of the date the user made the bid with the next bid and the bid price given

This query selects the product model, the user id, the first bid date, the next bid date, the first bid price, and the next bid price for each user who made a bid on a specific car model. It joins the `product` and `bid` tables by their foreign keys and filters the result by the product model column.

```sql
SELECT
  p.product_model AS model,
  b.user_id AS user_id,
  b.bid_time AS first_bid_date,
  LEAD(b.bid_time) OVER (PARTITION BY b.user_id ORDER BY b.bid_time) AS next_bid_date,
  b.bid_amount AS first_bid_price,
  LEAD(b.bid_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY b.user_id ORDER BY b.bid_time) AS next_bid_price
FROM bid b
JOIN product p ON p.product_id = b.advertisement_id
WHERE p.product_model = 'march';
```

 It uses window functions with lead functions to get the next bid date and price for each user. It assumes that the product model is already known.

![Find the comparison of the date the user made the bid with the next bid and the bid price given](images/analytical-query-03.png)

### 4. Compare the percentage difference between the average car price based on the model and the average bid price offered by the customer in the last 6 months

This query selects the product model, the average car price, the average bid price in the last 6 months, the difference, and the percentage difference between them for each product model. It joins the `product` and `bid` tables by their foreign keys and groups the result by the product model column. It uses window functions with filter clauses to get the average bid price in the last 6 months. It calculates the difference and percentage difference using arithmetic operations.

##### Create a view to join the relevant tables

This query creates a view called `car_bid` that joins the `product`, `advertisement`, and `bid` tables by their foreign keys and selects the product brand, model, bid amount, and bid time columns. The view can be used to simplify the subsequent queries on the car bids.

```sql
-- Create a view to join the relevant tables
CREATE VIEW car_bid AS
SELECT p.product_brand, p.product_model, b.bid_amount, b.bid_time
FROM product p
JOIN advertisement a ON p.product_id = a.product_id
JOIN bid b ON a.advertisement_id = b.advertisement_id;
```

And then use the SELECT statement to view the `car_bid` as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM car_bid;
```

![Create a view to join the relevant tables](images/analytical-query-05a.png)

### 5. Create a window function for the average bid price of a brand and car model for the last 6 months. Let's use Nissan March as an example.


#### Use the `car_bid` view to calculate the average bid price for each car brand and model for each month

This query uses the `car_bid` view to calculate the average bid price for each car brand and model for each month. It filters the result by a specific product brand and model using the WHERE clause. It uses window functions with filter clauses to get the average bid price for each month using the `DATE_PART` function. 


```sql
-- 5. Use the view to calculate the average bid price for each car brand and model for each month
SELECT product_brand AS merk, product_model AS model,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 6) AS m_min_6,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 5) AS m_min_5,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 4) AS m_min_4,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 3) AS m_min_3,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 2) AS m_min_2,
AVG(bid_amount) FILTER (WHERE DATE_PART('month', bid_time) = DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) - 1) AS m_min_1
FROM car_bid
WHERE product_brand = 'nissan' AND product_model = 'note'
GROUP BY product_brand, product_model;
```
It returns the result in a tabular format.
